<h1>METAVERSE</h1>
<div class="sect">
	<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><section class="section1"><h2>IMPLEMENTATION</h2><p>Components of metaverse technology have already been developed within online video games The eUniverse 1999 LivePlace “social interaction” platform or the 2003 virtual world platform Second Life are often described as the first metaverse, as it incorporated many aspects of social media into a persistent three-dimensional world with the user represented as an avatar, however historical claims of metaverse development started soon after the term was coined. Early projects included Active Worlds and The Palace. In 2017, Microsoft acquired the VR company AltspaceVR, and has implemented virtual avatars and meetings held in virtual reality into Microsoft Teams.</p></section></div>
<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6"><section class="section2"><h2>TECHNOLOGY - HARDWARE</h2>
	<p>Access points for the metaverse includes general-purpose computers and smartphones, augmented reality, mixed reality, and virtual reality
Dependence on VR technology has limited metaverse development and wide-scale adoption. Limitations of portable hardware and the need to balance cost and design have caused a lack of high-quality graphics and mobility. Lightweight wireless headsets have struggled to achieve retina display pixel density needed for visual immersion. Another issue for wide-scale adoption of the technology is cost, with consumer VR headsets ranging in price from $300 to $3500 as of 2022.Current hardware development is focused on overcoming limitations of VR headsets</p></section></div>

<div class="col-lg-4 col-md-12"><section class="Section3"><h2>TECHNOLOGY - SOFTWARE</h2><p>There has been no wide-scale adoption of a standardized technical specification for metaverse implementations, and existing implementations rely primarily on proprietary technology. Interoperability is a major concern in metaverse development, stemming from concerns about transparency and privacy. There have been several virtual environment standardization projects.
Universal Scene Description is a specification for 3D computer graphics interchange created by Pixar and supported by Blender, Apple's Scenekit and Autodesk 3ds Max.The technology company NVIDIA announced in 2021 they would adopt USD for their metaverse development tools.
